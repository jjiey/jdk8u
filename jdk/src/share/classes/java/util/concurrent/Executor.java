/**
 * An object that executes submitted {@link Runnable} tasks. This
 * interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the
 * mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread
 * use, scheduling, etc.  An {@code Executor} is normally used
 * instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 * invoking {@code new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()} for each
 * of a set of tasks, you might use:
 * 翻译：用来执行提交的 Runnable 任务。该接口提供了一种 将任务提交与每个任务如何运行的机制 解耦的方式，包括线程使用、调度等细节。通常使用 Executor 来替代显式地创建线程。例如，执行一组任务中的每个任务，你可以像下面这样使用（而不是调用 new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()）：
 *
 * <pre>
 * Executor executor = <em>anExecutor</em>;
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * However, the {@code Executor} interface does not strictly
 * require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an
 * executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's
 * thread:
 * 翻译：Executor 接口并不严格要求执行是异步的。在最简单的情况下，executor 可以在调用者的线程中立即运行提交的任务：
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     r.run();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other
 * than the caller's thread.  The executor below spawns a new thread
 * for each task.
 * 翻译：更典型的情况是任务在调用者线程之外的某个线程中执行。下面这个 executor 为每个任务生成一个新线程。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     new Thread(r).start();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Many {@code Executor} implementations impose some sort of
 * limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled.  The executor below
 * serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor,
 * illustrating a composite executor.
 * 翻译：许多 Executor 实现对 任务的调度方式和时间 强加了某种限制。下面的 executor 串行化将任务提交给第二个 executor，展示了一个复合的 executor。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
 *   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<Runnable>();
 *   final Executor executor;
 *   Runnable active;
 *
 *   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
 *     this.executor = executor;
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
 *     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         try {
 *           r.run();
 *         } finally {
 *           scheduleNext();
 *         }
 *       }
 *     });
 *     if (active == null) {
 *       scheduleNext();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
 *     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
 *       executor.execute(active);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@code Executor} implementations provided in this package
 * implement {@link ExecutorService}, which is a more extensive
 * interface.  The {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} class provides an
 * extensible thread pool implementation. The {@link Executors} class
 * provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
 * 翻译：此 package 中提供的 Executor 实现其实是实现了 ExecutorService，这是一个更广泛的接口。ThreadPoolExecutor 类提供了一个可扩展的线程池实现。Executors 类为这些 Executors 提供了方便的工厂方法。
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 * submitting a {@code Runnable} object to an {@code Executor}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
 * 翻译：内存一致性影响：将 Runnable 对象提交给 Executor 之前，线程中的操作 先行发生于 Executor 开始执行，可能在另一个线程中。
